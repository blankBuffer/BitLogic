**Features**

*write your questions in plain english like wolfram alpha.(buggy as heck and fairly limited)

*differenciate and integrate equations symbolically and numerically (partial fractions is being re written for the time being so it is disabled, also have not implimented trig and weirstrass substitutions)

*simplify distribute and factor (factoring of all integer roots of a polynomial can be found)

*plot equations

*solve equations numerically or symbolically

*save expressions to disk

*rpn, algebraic, english interpreter combined

*perfect power and prime factorization(not accesable by user


Please do not claim for any of the project to be your own. This is designed by Benjamin Robert Currie.
You may use it for your projects if I am referenced. This project uses JDA (java discord API for the discord bot).

If you want to use discord bot it requires two things, the access token and the id (event.getAuthor().getId()) for the owner of the bot.

My progress of this project was available on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZPoceixYFsH3ATvvhuf9og/videos
(ive stopped making videos for the time being because very time consuming and Ive changed my mind on alot of the design)

Completely re written with many new techniques.

simple GUI (not polished but functional), I preder to use non gui mode myself.

Boolean algebra implemented

Both RPN and algebraic input.

The tigonometry is not fully implemented 



Please be kind about my implemntations, I am not a mathmetician by any means. Ive only taken classes up to integral calculus so I may not do things in optimal ways. I also have not read any CAS books so there are most certainly logic problems with my design. That being said I do try my best
