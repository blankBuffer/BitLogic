	<h1>Algebraic functions and Manipulations</h1>
	
	<h2>Definitions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Defining variables</li>
		<p>
		To define a variable, use the := operator.<br>
		To make a variable 'a' with a value of 5 type.<br><br>
		
		a:=5<br>
		hit ENTER<br><br>
		
		So far the variable has not been defined. It has only been prepared to become defined. To actually execute the command type.<br><br>
		
		result<br>
		hit ENTER<br><br>
		
		The stack should not have a variable called "done!". You can delete it by typing<br><br>
		
		pop<br>
		hit ENTER<br><br>
		
		</p>
		<li>Defining functions</li>
		<p>
		Defining functions is very similar to defining variables.<br>
		To make a function f(a,b) that returns a^2+b type.<br><br>
		
		f(a,b):=a^2+b<br>
		hit ENTER<br><br>
		
		Now to execute the definition type.<br><br>
		
		result<br>
		hit ENTER<br><br>
		</p>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Solving an Equation</h2>
	<p>
	The syntax is solve(equation,variable)<br>
	Suppose the equation in question is 3x^2-2x-7=0 type<br><br>
	
	solve(3*x^2-2*x-7=0,x)<br>
	hit ENTER<br>
	result<br>
	hit ENTER<br><br>
	
	The solutions to that quadratic should be returned.<br>
	You can also ask the problem in a more english like query like...<br><br>
	
	What are the roots to 3*x^2-2*x-7 in terms of x
